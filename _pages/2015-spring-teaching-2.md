 - I had the opportunity to present 30 lab sessions to undergraduate students. These labs were designed to introduce students to various concepts and tools in the field of electrical engineering, including Labview software, building and connecting circuits to Labview software and processing data using Mydaq and CRIO devices, and Microcontroller programming using MPLAB X software.
- During these lab sessions, I was responsible for guiding students through the hands-on learning process, ensuring that they had a solid understanding of the material and were able to complete the lab exercises successfully. I also provided individual support to students during office hours and helped them troubleshoot any issues they encountered.
- Through my experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I was able to develop a strong understanding of Labview, myDAQ, cRIO, and MPLAB X software, as well as gain valuable communication and leadership skills. I found that I particularly enjoyed working with students and helping them develop their skills in electrical engineering.
