[Dr. Natarajamani S](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/s-natarajamani/), Professor at Amrita College of Engineering

"He had very high grasping capacity and took part actively in all course activities and classroom discussions. He is very attentive student in class and also being on time with his submissions. I am part of the project review panel for final year ECE student, so this gave me an opportunity to review his presentation skills and his technical knowledge. A good example of this is when he presented a paper on Antenna Miniaturization which is his final year project. During his presentation, he proved not only his strong technical knowledge but also his communication skills. He has a curious mind and good interpretation ability that will greatly facilitate research work in your university. In addition, he has a great avidity for growing his knowledge by pursuing his graduate studies."

[Prof. Vidya L](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/l-vidhya/), Professor at Amrita College of Engineering

"Denesh has consistently impressed me with his course work wherein he was able to correlate concepts of Control System with Linear Integrated Circuits. He has shown great dedication by venturing beyond the scope of the subject ideas. I have overseen a few of his term projects on Micro-Strip Antenna Design for Energy Harvest, Fever Detection System and Obstacle Avoidance Robot and observed his competence in practically applying theoretical concepts. He was among the top 5% students of his class. He is an attentive student and has strong critical thinking and analytical skills. He is a confident student with no hesitance to interact in class."

"Through my observation, Denesh is a very sincere and diligent student with sufficient motivation been consistent in his studies. He is a very attentive student in class receptive to new ideas and took active participation in classroom activities. Denesh has also done Microcontroller Lab course under my guidance. During this session he has proved his ability to correlate theoretical classes with practical lab sessions and when he came across some challenges in design and coding he figured out the root cause and solved the same. He performed exemplarily well in his lab and has never been late with his submissions of assignments and record works."
