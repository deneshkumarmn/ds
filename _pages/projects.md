**Business Analyst, Walmart Weekly Sales Analysis and Prediction**
#### March 2020 - June 2020 | Pennsylvania, USA

-----
*	Analyzed Walmarts weekly sales data from 45 stores to gain insights into their sales performance and identify trends and patterns that could improve business optimization and strategic decisions
*	Analyzed holiday periods experience significant spikes in sales due to festivals and discounts. Predicted total revenue of a grocery store for the forthcoming months by applying FBProphet model on accrued time-series data <br>

**Machine Learning, Attendance System**
#### May 2020 | Pennsylvania, USA

-----
* This is a vision bases attendance system which detects and recognises peoples presence and marks their attendance. 
*	The proposed method includes two stages working sequentially. The face detection task is executed to find any person present in the current frame. A deep learning architecture, Multi-task Cascaded Neural Network (MTCNN), is used to carry out the detecting phase.
*	The face detection will be initialized and after detection process the face embedding of the detected person is generated. 
*	The ArcFace, Additive angular margin loss for deep face recognition is used to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition.
