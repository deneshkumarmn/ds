Hey, thanks for visiting my website. I’m Denesh - a recent (2023) graduate from the Pennsylvania State University. Data Scientist with two year of experience executing data-driven solution to increase efficiency, accuracy, and utility of internal data processing. Experienced at creating data regression models, and using predictive data modeling to deliver insights and implement action-oriented solution to complex industrial problems.

I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and stay committed to continuous learning, staying updated with the latest trends in AI and data science. I’m super enthusiastic about learning new technologies and how these can be best used in my job! I often gravitate towards project making me think out of the box and am always up for any new and exciting opportunities coming my way.

Oh, and also, I’m a HUGE cricket fan also I love white water kayaking and Ice climbing. I have recently summit mount Algonquin Peak (Second largest peak in east cost). Hit me up if you want to talk sports, adventure, machine learning, data science, or anything fun in life! :)

### Data Scientist [ONEBIT](https://onebitapp.com/) <br>
###### June 2023 - Nov 2023, Chicago, US <br>
------

- Implemented AWS Glue for automated data ingestion, transformation, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, ensuring efficient data processing and integration from various sources, including bank transactions, invoices, and
expense receipts from S3 bucket.
- Utilized AWS warehouse for storing and managing large volumes of financial data from various sources such as bank
transactions, invoices, and expense receipts. Utilizing its cloud-native architecture and elastic scalability to efficiently
store, organize, and analyze financial data.
- Leveraged AWS Lambda to develop real-time data integration solutions, securely connecting with financial institution’s
APIs and extracting transactional data on-the-fly, guaranteeing accurate and up-to-date financial information.
- Employed AWS CloudFormation to automate the infrastructure provisioning process, enabling repeatable and consistent
deployments of data pipelines, and ensuring easy scalability and manageability.

### Data Scientist [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) <br>
###### May 2022 - Sep 2022, Remote, US <br>
------
- Collected data from various sources such as REST API, MySQL server and stored it in AWS S3 Data Lake.
- Built ETL pipeline with the help of AWS Glue and used AWS EC2 to cleanse, mask and transform raw data into the
canonical form.
- Stored various transformed databases in AWS Redshift for analysis. Used Qlik Sense to create dashboard and improved
business profit by 18%.
- Used clustering models to cluster into several groups. Used several Machine Learning Algorithms for each cluster and
found out that XGBoost Algorithm performed the best.
- F1 score was the metric used to evaluate the algorithm performance and the project was deployed using Streamlit
framework

### Data Scientist [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) <br>
###### Feb 2021 - July 2021, Remote, US <br>
------
- Used QGIS software to perform in-depth analysis and processing of Sentinel 2 data.
- Stored all the raw data in AWS S3 and after transformation shifted the data into AWS Redshift for different use
cases.Created datasets in image format and csv format.
- Built Machine Learning models using the csv format and Computer Vision models using image format for farming habit
at classification for classifying commercial crops and peripheral habitats on farm that can be used by food industry bodies to contextualize on-farm data that is self-reported by farmers.
