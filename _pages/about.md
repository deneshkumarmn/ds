Hey, thanks for visiting my website. I’m Denesh - a recent (2023) graduate from the Pennsylvania State University. Data Enthusiast with two year of experience executing data-driven solution to increase efficiency, accuracy, and utility of internal data processing. Experienced at designing data warehouse, data pipeline and data orchestration using cloud services, and using predictive data modeling to deliver insights and implement action-oriented solution to complex industrial problems.

I hold a Master's degree specializing in Data Science and stay committed to continuous learning, staying updated with the latest trends in data profession. I’m super enthusiastic about learning new technologies and how these can be best used in my job! I often gravitate towards project making me think out of the box and am always up for any new and exciting opportunities coming my way.

Oh, and also, I love playing chess also I love white water kayaking and Ice climbing. I have recently summit mount Algonquin Peak (Second largest peak in east cost). Hit me up if you want to talk sports, adventure, machine learning, data engineering, or anything fun in life! :)

**Data Sceince Research, [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/)** 
#### US
----- 
*	Work with Das Research group with Dr. Saptarshi Das to explore the advantage of Monotonic nature of dendrite application in
neural networks
*	Defined dendrite activation function and used it as a pre-filter stage and compare model accuracy and speed to traditional ANN
*	Achieved target accuracy with fewer layers in the dendritic model, reducing the need for deep architectures
*	Compared neuron and synapse count, showing significant reductions (up to 57.3%) in dendritic ANNs over traditional models
*	Developed a multi-class deep learning model to classify different amino acids, use SHAP to interpret model predictions and
identify key features influencing classification
