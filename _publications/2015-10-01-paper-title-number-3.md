This paper presents a design of single-fed circularly polarized patch antenna at 2.4 GHz-band for RF energy harvesting application. The irregular shaped patch is obtained by genetic algorithm optimization technique. The fitness function for circular polarization and return loss has reliably conflated in the genetic algorithm. The optimized irregular shaped single-fed microstrip patch antenna is designed using Matlab and HFSS software and the simulated result shows a return loss of -15.498 dB and the axial ratio of 2.09 dB at 2.41 GHz resonating frequency.
