Pyranometers are vital when it comes to solar power. Pyranometers are sensors that give us the reading for Irradiance. The main problem with many pyranometers is that they are inaccurate at certain times given that the calibration performed by the manufacturing companies will be done on a hardware basis but can improve the accuracy further on a software basis using soft computing techniques like regression. The growing energy deficit in the world has created a wanting for renewable energy sources like solar power and solar power has to be estimated accurately as it helps grid engineers make important decisions like voltage control and frequency control that are vital to the stable working of a solar grid but if pyranometers give us inaccurate readings for irradiance, solar power won't be estimated accurately so in this paper, regression model is proposed that has improved the accuracy of a particular pyranometer.
